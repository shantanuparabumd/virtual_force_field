## Introduction
The VFF (Virtual Force Field) navigation algorithm offers an efficient approach to robot navigation by leveraging the principles of repulsive and attractive forces. In this project, we have implemented the logic of the VFF navigation algorithm, where each object in the environment generates a repulsive force pushing the robot away, while the destination generates an attractive force pulling the robot towards it. By integrating these forces, the robot can navigate towards the target while avoiding obstacles, ensuring both efficiency and safety in its path.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of the VFF navigation algorithm, focusing on achieving efficient and safe navigation for a robot in dynamic environments. We aim to provide a solution that allows the robot to reach its destination as quickly as possible while prioritizing the safest path by intelligently navigating around obstacles. Through this project, we showcase the versatility and effectiveness of the VFF algorithm in real-world navigation scenarios, offering insights into its potential applications in robotics and autonomous systems.

## Setup and Installation

The project works on a docker image provided by JDE Robotics.
